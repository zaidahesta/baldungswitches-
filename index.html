<p class="head">A brief introduction</p>
<p class ="arial"> 
The Witches (1510) by Hans Baldung is one of the most well-known images of witches in the world. But what exactly are we looking at? <br>
<br> 	
The five nude witches are each participating in a specific magic ritual. The woman on the right (1) is performing a weather spell, a wave of dense clouds is 
escaping from the pot between her legs. Weather spells were considered to be extremely malicious as hail or a storm could ruin crops and cause hunger. The woman in the middle (2) 
is holding two things in her wiry, outstretched arms: a plate with gross-looking meat and a piece of dark cloth which originates between her legs. She is offering a plate of innards 
and a dark cloth to the Devil, as a dark inverse of the Catholic mass. The woman on the left (3) is also participating in this ‘dark mass’ by holding up a goblet. The last witch on the ground (4) is difficult to spot. She is holding up a long pole with 
a large cup on the end, placed strategically below the flying goat. This goat carries the last witch (5) who is looking at the pot full of sludge she is holding in a dangerously long, two-pronged pitchfork.

If the witches are the main attraction, the giant roller coaster if you will, consider the rest of the woodcut the side attractions: the haunted mansion, the bumper cars, the merry-go-round. 
	In the bottom left corner, we see a large horse skull and some human remains – definitely part of the haunted mansion. These bones, as well as the dead tree, signify the way in which the witches are the inverse of the Christian woman: instead of bringing life, they bring death. Our bumper cars are the elements which both attract and revolt the viewer. The puking cat in the right corner reminds us of the idea of familiars, magical animals that would do the witches’ evil bidding. A grinning goat is hanging over a pitchfork from which a large jug and three sausages are dangling, eerily similar to male genitalia. From the late Middle Ages forward, witchcraft is connected to female sexuality. Women are seen as intensely lustful creatures, willing to make a deal with the Devil to satisfy their urges. 
 	Finally, our merry-go-round, the ride tying everything together: the religious references. The large pot in the centre is inscribed with pseudo-Hebrew marks. The belief that ‘the Jews’ killed Jesus made them convenient scapegoats for all troubles plaguing the Christian world including war, famine, the plague and, of course, witchcraft. The Cardinal’s hat, the aspergillum*, the rolled-up piece of parchment and the money pouch laying on the ground are references to the Catholic Church. These objects show the witches’ rejection of Christianity, as well as the religious turbulence in the Early Modern period. Finally, the double prongs of the pitchforks on the ground remind us of Devil horns - lest we forget who the witches are in league with..<br>
